# Introduction to clasew-excel DSL

***clasew*** is based on a core set of primitives for calling AppleScript vis-a-vis the Java ScriptManager interop. The DSLs (delivered and planned) leverage these primitives to simplify the developer interface to targeted applications. However; you can use them for whatever type AppleScript you want evaluated.

***clasew.excel*** is a DSL that builds on ***clasew.core***. Go [here](intro.md) for more informaiton on clasew.core.

The focus of this page are the higher order functions (HOF), found in the clasew.excel namespace, that can be utilized to simplify interacting with Excel.

## clasew.excel
As noted in the introduction, the main functions in this namespace are HOFs that provide a DSL that, under the covers, call the clasew.core primitive functions.

Unlike clasew.core, clasew.excel functions do not require providing an engine instance.
